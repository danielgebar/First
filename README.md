# The Los Angeles Lakers
A website providng news and feedback on the greatest franchise EVER!
### Three reasons this is my favorite team are that I grew up a Kobe fan my whole life, The first city I traveled to when I was younger was Los Angeles and sadly mt local city does not have a basketball team. 
## The Lakers have been my favorite team since I was six and the reason why I decided to make this site is to give another prespective on the team to fans across the world.
